combat messages change color based on intensity of attack.
added laser pointer - use it to blind and confuse your enemies
bumping into a wall no longer spends a turn.
items can be dropped. useful if you hit the limit.

0.05a - forgot to implement most of thirst code. whoops.
added some thirst-quenching items and changed needs rates.

0.05 - basic needs!
hunger and thirst now increases and needs to be managed.
maxing either hunger or thirst causes the player to lose health.
fixed a bug where enemies would spawn beneath the player.
press enter to save a screenshot in the executable directory
fade-in on game start.
items now have multiple use functions, where only the primary prints a message.
consuming food/drinks has various fun messages.
some food also quenches thirst, and vice versa.

0.04b - pickup prefix messages now randomized and picked from a list.

0.04a - INVENTORY! items can now be picked up, stored and used. even corpses! try eating one.
attack onomatopoeia added. big list of pow/biff/wham/etc. not yet grouped by attack damage.
VERY early basic needs system implemented. as of now, hunger/thirst do not increase.
slightly restructured GUI to allow for more messages in the log panel.

0.04 - updated libtcod from 1.5 to 1.5.1! slightly better performance and other fun things!
added health potions that do nothing. fun!
attack intensity flavor text! chooses a random attack message from each tier of attack severity.
the more damage an attack is, the more powerful the text becomes! calculated in percentages, so you don't get the same messages dealing 10hp to a demigod as you would on a mutated fish.
critical hits reworked slightly, they now ignore enemy defense.
monster and item spawning also reworked, now they don't spawn in walls. also, if a spawn fails, it gets discarded.
key handling changed AGAIN to allow for 1.5.1. no more firing off on key releases.

0.03a - changed .exe builder to pyInstaller. bigger filesize, less files.

simple look command. currently just checks entire fov
walking over items prints a message as well.

0.02 - actual combat, with death and corpse spawning. an actual game!
enemies chase you AND attack. now you can die, too.
fixed a bug in the rendering system that caused corpses to show up only after player movement. 
added "violent deaths", one of many gore gimmicks, at 120% damage of max hp

0.01 - dungeon generator with field of view
dungeon generation allows for intersecting rooms.
fog of war introduced.
objects can now block, and have names.
object spawners spawn objects based on percentage rates, as well as working on a per-room basis.
many, many constants to easily tweak config.
movement script changed to use collission detection, as well as a 20 FPS limit to make controls more precise.
combat turns and attacking are placeholder messages printed to console
enemies chase you as long as they are in your FoV.
combat! sort of. the dealing and taking of damage is implemented, death isn't.
simple gui with just an HP counter for now.
objects can now hold components, rather than just properties. FUN!
